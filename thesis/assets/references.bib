	abstract = {Dyslexia is a neurological problem that leads to obstacles and difficulties in the learning process, especially in reading. Generally, people with dyslexia suffer from weak reading, writing, spelling, and fluency abilities. However, these difficulties are not related to their intelligence. An early diagnosis of this disorder will help dyslexic children improve their abilities using appropriate tools and specialized software. Machine learning and deep learning methods have been implemented to recognize dyslexia with various datasets related to dyslexia acquired from medical and educational organizations. This review paper analyzed the prediction performance of deep learning models for dyslexia and summarizes the challenges researchers face when they use deep learning models for classification and diagnosis. Using the PRISMA protocol, 19 articles were reviewed and analyzed, with a focus on data acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, and the prediction model performance. The purpose of this review was to aid researchers in building a predictive model for dyslexia based on available dyslexia-related datasets. The paper demonstrated some challenges that researchers encounter in this field and must overcome.},

	abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is the commonly employed electro-biological imaging technique for diagnosing brain functioning. The EEG signals are used to determine head injury, ascertain brain cell functioning, and monitor brain development. EEG can add multiple dimensions towards the identification of learning disability being an abnormality of the brain. Early and accurate detection of brain diseases can significantly reduce the mortality rate with a lesser treatment cost. The machine learning techniques can examine, classify, and process EEG signals to accurately understand brain activities and disorders. This paper is a comprehensive review of the application of machine learning techniques in the classification of EEG signals of dyslexia and analysis of an improved framework to extemporize the classifier’s performance and accuracy in discriminating between dyslexics and controls. The presence of noises and artefacts often reduces the performance of classifiers and hampers results. This study reviews input pre-processing, feature selection, feature extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms for the early detection of disorder. The SVM was found to be outperforming other machine learning techniques for the classification of EEG signals.},

For each of the following diseases, we performed systematic literature reviews and analyzed resulting data: eczema, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, pruritus, alopecia areata, decubitus ulcer, urticaria, scabies, fungal skin diseases, impetigo, abscess, and other bacterial skin diseases, cellulitis, viral warts, molluscum contagiosum, and non-melanoma skin cancer. We used disability estimates to determine nonfatal burden. Three skin conditions, fungal skin diseases, other skin and subcutaneous diseases, and acne were in the top 10 most prevalent diseases worldwide in 2010, and eight fell into the top 50; these additional five skin problems were pruritus, eczema, impetigo, scabies, and molluscum contagiosum. Collectively, skin conditions ranged from the 2nd to 11th leading cause of years lived with disability at the country level. At the global level, skin conditions were the fourth leading cause of nonfatal disease burden. Using more data than has been used previously, the burden due to these diseases is enormous in both high- and low-income countries. These results argue strongly to include skin disease prevention and treatment in future global health strategies as a matter of urgency.},

We present a deep learning system (DLS) to provide a differential diagnosis of skin conditions using 16,114 de-identified cases (photographs and clinical data) from a teledermatology practice serving 17 sites. The DLS distinguishes between 26 common skin conditions, representing 80\% of cases seen in primary care, while also providing a secondary prediction covering 419 skin conditions. On 963 validation cases, where a rotating panel of three board-certified dermatologists defined the reference standard, the DLS was non-inferior to six other dermatologists and superior to six primary care physicians (PCPs) and six nurse practitioners (NPs) (top-1 accuracy: 0.66 DLS, 0.63 dermatologists, 0.44 PCPs and 0.40 NPs). These results highlight the potential of the DLS to assist general practitioners in diagnosing skin conditions.},

Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of AI involving statistical models and algorithms that can progressively learn from data to predict the characteristics of new samples and perform a desired task. Although it has a significant role in the detection of skin cancer, dermatology skill lags behind radiology in terms of AI acceptance. With continuous spread, use, and emerging technologies, AI is becoming more widely available even to the general population. AI can be of use for the early detection of skin cancer. For example, the use of deep convolutional neural networks can help to develop a system to evaluate images of the skin to diagnose skin cancer. Early detection is key for the effective treatment and better outcomes of skin cancer. Specialists can accurately diagnose the cancer, however, considering their limited numbers, there is a need to develop automated systems that can diagnose the disease efficiently to save lives and reduce health and financial burdens on the patients. ML can be of significant use in this regard. In this article, we discuss the fundamentals of ML and its potential in assisting the diagnosis of skin cancer.},

	abstract = {The deployment of wearable wireless systems that collect physiological indicators to aid in diagnosing neurological disorders represents a potential solution for the new generation of e-health systems. Electroencephalography (EEG), a recording of the brain’s electrical activity, is a promising physiological test for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders. It can identify the abnormalities of the neural system that are associated with autism spectrum disorders. However, streaming EEG samples remotely for classification can reduce the wireless sensor’s lifespan and creates doubt regarding the application’s feasibility. Therefore, decreasing data transmission may conserve sensor energy and extend the lifespan of wireless sensor networks. This paper suggests the development of a sensor-based scheme for early age autism detection. The proposed scheme implements an energy-efficient method for signal transformation allowing relevant feature extraction for accurate classification using machine learning algorithms. The experimental results indicate an accuracy of 96\%, a sensitivity of 100\%, and around 95\% of F1 score for all used machine learning models. The results also show that our scheme energy consumption is 97\% lower than streaming the raw EEG samples.},

The electroencephalographic (EEG) was recorded during an eyes-closed resting condition from 21 monopolar derivations, which were clustered into nine regions for analysis. The EEGs were Fourier-transformed to provide absolute and relative power estimates for the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. Ratio coefficients were also calculated for the theta/alpha and theta/beta ratios. Compared with controls, the clinical groups demonstrated the increased slow-wave and reduced fast-wave activity commonly reported in the ADHD literature. The ADHD + RD group had more relative theta, less relative alpha, and a higher theta/alpha ratio than the ADHD group. A number of hemispheric differences were also found in the delta and alpha bands.

	abstract = {Background
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and or impulsivity. Since the development of the concept, a reliable biomarker to aid diagnosis has been sought. One potential method is the use of electroencephalogram to measure neuronal activity. The aim of this review is to provide an up to date synthesis of the literature surrounding the potential use of electroencephalogram for diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adulthood.

Methods
A search of PsycINFO, PubMed, and EMBASE was undertaken in February 2019 for peer-reviewed articles exploring electroencephalogram patterns in adults (18 years with no upper limit) diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Results
Differences in electroencephalogram activity are potentially unique to adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder populations. Strongest support was derived for elevated levels of both absolute and relative theta power, alongside the observation that alpha activity is able to typically differentiate between adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and normative populations.

Conclusions
Electroencephalogram can have a use in clinical settings to aid adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis, but areas of inconsistency are apparent.},

	abstract = {This study considers the differential predictive value of rapid naming tests for various aspects of later reading, where the differential is between nondisabled and poor readers. Two large-N longitudinal samples of students who have been evaluated from third through eighth grades are studied: (a) a randomly accessed, normally distributed group including students with varying degrees of reading ability (N = 154), and (b) a group of poor readers whose single-word reading in third grade is at or below the population 10th percentile (N = 64). Outcomes in fifth and eighth grade were measured in both groups. Single-word reading in both grades was strongly predicted from third-grade rapid naming only within the poor readers, even when IQ, socioeconomc status, and third-grade single-word reading were statistically controlled. Although rapid naming had predictive value within the large, normally distributed group, its predictive power was entirely absent in the average-reading nondisabled students who were between the 10th and 90th percentiles (n = 122). The fact that rapid naming has predictive power only for poor readers but not for average readers is interpreted as suggesting that impaired readers are qualitatively different from the normal-reading population and are not simply the “tail” of a normal distribution of reading ability. It also seems that it is the automaticity of retrieval, not the knowledge of names itself (as in confrontational naming tasks), that gives the predictive power in rapid naming. These data are considered in light of the one-and two-factor theories of the underlying processes involved in reading disability or dyslexia.},

PA and RAN were measured in kindergarten and Grade 1, while word recognition, phonological decoding, and spelling were measured in kindergarten, Grade 1, and Grade 2. In general, high stability was observed for the various reading and spelling measures, such that little additional variance was left open for PA and RAN. However, results demonstrated that RAN was more related to reading than spelling across orthographies, with the opposite pattern shown for PA. In addition, tests of measurement invariance show that the factor loadings of each observed indicator on the latent PA factor was the same across U.S./Australia and Scandinavia. Similar findings were obtained for RAN. In general, tests of structural invariance show that models of early literacy development are highly transferable across languages.},

Factor analyses of these cognitive variables (including auditory processing, phonological awareness, short-term auditory memory, visual memory, rapid automatized naming, and visual processing speed) produced three empirically and theoretically derived factors (auditory processing, visual processing/speed, and memory), each of which contributed to the prediction of reading and spelling skills. Factor scores from the three factors combined predicted 85\% of the variance associated with letter/sight word naming, 70\% of the variance associated with reading comprehension, 73\% for spelling, and 61\% for phonetic decoding. The auditory processing factor was the strongest predictor, accounting for 27\% to 43\% of the variance across the different achievement areas. The results provide practitioner and researcher with theoretical and empirical support for the inclusion of measures of the three factors, in addition to specific measures of reading achievement, in a standardized assessment of dyslexia. Guidelines for a thorough, research-based assessment are provided.},
