	abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging are essential tools for the analysis of organized neural systems in working and resting states, both in physiological and pathological conditions. They provide evidence of coupled metabolic and cerebral local blood flow changes that strictly depend upon cellular activity. In 1890, Charles Smart Roy and Charles Scott Sherrington suggested a link between brain circulation and metabolism. In the same year William James, in his introduction of the concept of brain blood flow variations during mental activities, briefly reported the studies of the Italian physiologist Angelo Mosso, a multifaceted researcher interested in the human circulatory system. James focused on Mosso’s recordings of brain pulsations in patients with skull breaches, and in the process only briefly referred to another invention of Mosso’s, the ‘human circulation balance’, which could non-invasively measure the redistribution of blood during emotional and intellectual activity. However, the details and precise workings of this instrument and the experiments Mosso performed with it have remained largely unknown. Having found Mosso’s original manuscripts in the archives, we remind the scientific community of his experiments with the ‘human circulation balance’ and of his establishment of the conceptual basis of non-invasive functional neuroimaging techniques. Mosso unearthed and investigated several critical variables that are still relevant in modern neuroimaging such as the ‘signal-to-noise ratio’, the appropriate choice of the experimental paradigm and the need for the simultaneous recording of differing physiological parameters.},

Biodegradable plastics could be part of the solution to this problem, but they also present challenges. Biodegradability depends not only on the properties of the plastic material itself, but also on the environmental conditions. Many biodegradable plastic products only actually biodegrade in certain specific environments, or only in industrial composting facilities, rather than in the open environment more generally. The opinion recommends limiting the use of biodegradable plastics in the open environment to specific applications for which reduction, reuse, and recycling are not feasible, rather than as a solution for inappropriate waste management or littering. To realize the potential environmental benefits over conventional plastics, it recommends supporting the development of coherent testing and certification standards. It also identifies a need to promote the supply of accurate information on the properties, appropriate use and disposal, and limitations of biodegradable plastics and their applications to relevant user groups.},

	abstract = {Lapses in attention can have serious consequences in situations such as driving a car, hence there is considerable interest in tracking it using neural measures. However, as most of these studies have been done in highly controlled and artificial laboratory settings, we want to explore whether it is also possible to determine attention and distraction using electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected in a natural setting using machine/deep learning. 24 participants volunteered for the study. Data were collected from pairs of participants simultaneously while they engaged in Tibetan Monastic debate, a practice that is interesting because it is a real-life situation that generates substantial variability in attention states. We found that attention was on average associated with increased left frontal alpha, increased left parietal theta, and decreased central delta compared to distraction. In an attempt to predict attention and distraction, we found that a Long Short Term Memory model classified attention and distraction with maximum accuracy of 95.86\% and 95.4\% corresponding to delta and theta waves respectively. This study demonstrates that EEG data collected in a real-life setting can be used to predict attention states in participants with good accuracy, opening doors for developing Brain-Computer Interfaces that track attention in real-time using data extracted in daily life settings, rendering them much more usable.},

Previous studies have identified correlations between electroencephalogram (EEG) spectrum power and a driver's mental states such as vigilance and alertness. Studies have also built classification models that can estimate vigilance state changes based on data collected from drivers. In the present study, we propose a system to detect vigilance level using not only a driver's EEG signals but also driving contexts as inputs. We combined a support vector machine with particle swarm optimization methods to improve classification accuracy. A simulated driving task was conducted to demonstrate the reliability of the proposed system. Twenty participants were assigned a 2-h sustained-attention driving task to identify a lead car's brake events. Our system was able to account for 84.1\% of experimental reaction times with 162-ms prediction errors. A newly introduced driving context factor, road curves, improved the prediction accuracy by 2-5\% with 30-80 ms smaller errors. These findings demonstrated the potential value of the proposed system for estimating driver vigilance level on a time scale of seconds.},

In this study, existing linear models that learn the mapping from neural activity to an attended speech envelope are replaced by a non-linear neural network (NN). The proposed architecture takes into account the temporal context of the estimated envelope and is evaluated using EEG data obtained from 20 normal-hearing listeners who focused on one speaker in a two-speaker setting. The network is optimized with respect to the frequency range and the temporal segmentation of the EEG input, as well as the cost function used to estimate the model parameters. To identify the salient cues involved in auditory attention, a relevance algorithm is applied that highlights the electrode signals most important for attention decoding. In contrast to linear approaches, the NN profits from a wider EEG frequency range (1–32 Hz) and achieves a performance seven times higher than the linear baseline. Relevant EEG activations following the speech stimulus after 170 ms at physiologically plausible locations were found. This was not observed when the model was trained on the unattended speaker. Our findings therefore indicate that non-linear NNs can provide insight into physiological processes by analyzing EEG activity.},

	abstract = {The human brain has often been viewed as outstanding among mammalian brains: the most cognitively able, the largest-than-expected from body size, endowed with an overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents over 80\% of brain mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and 10× more glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain. These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains: compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call for a re-examination of several concepts related to the exceptionality of the human brain.},

	abstract = {The first known neurophysiologic recordings of animals were performed by Richard Caton in 1875. The advent of recording the electrical activity of human beings took another half century to occur. Hans Berger, a German psychiatrist, pioneered the EEG in humans in 1924. The EEG is an electrophysiological technique for the recording of electrical activity arising from the human brain. Given its exquisite temporal sensitivity, the main utility of EEG is in the evaluation of dynamic cerebral functioning. EEG is particularly useful for evaluating patients with suspected seizures, epilepsy, and unusual spells. With certain exceptions, practically all patients with epilepsy will demonstrate characteristic EEG alterations during an epileptic seizure (ictal, or during-seizure, recordings). Most epilepsy patients also show characteristic interictal (or between-seizure) epileptiform discharges (IEDs) termed spike ({\textless}70 μsec duration), spike and wave, or sharp-wave (70–200 μsec duration) discharges. EEG has also been adopted for several other clinical indications. For example, EEG may be used to monitor the depth of anesthesia during surgical procedures; given its great sensitivity in showing sudden changes in neural functioning even as they first occur, it has proven quite helpful in this setting in monitoring for potential complications such as ischemia or infarction. EEG waveforms may also be averaged, giving rise to evoked potentials (EPs) and event-related potentials (ERPs), potentials that represent neural activity of interest that is temporally related to a specific stimulus. EPs and ERPs are used in clinical practice and research for analysis of visual, auditory, somatosensory, and higher cognitive functioning.},

We used disability estimates to determine nonfatal burden. Three skin conditions, fungal skin diseases, other skin and subcutaneous diseases, and acne were in the top 10 most prevalent diseases worldwide in 2010, and eight fell into the top 50; these additional five skin problems were pruritus, eczema, impetigo, scabies, and molluscum contagiosum. Collectively, skin conditions ranged from the 2nd to 11th leading cause of years lived with disability at the country level. At the global level, skin conditions were the fourth leading cause of nonfatal disease burden. Using more data than has been used previously, the burden due to these diseases is enormous in both high- and low-income countries.

	abstract = {Neurological disorders are diseases that affect the brain and the central autonomic nervous systems. These disorders take a huge toll on an individual's health and general well-being. After cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders are the main cause of death. These disorders include epilepsy, Alzheimer  ’  s disease, dementia, cerebrovascular diseases including stroke, migraine, Parkinso  n  ’s disease and numerous other disorders. This manuscript presents a state-of-the-art consolidated review of research on the diagnosis of the three most common neurological disorders using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with machine learning techniques. The disorders discussed in this manuscript are the more prevalent disorders   like   epilepsy, Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and Alzheimer’s disease. This manuscript helps in understanding the details about EEG signal processing for diagnosis and analysis of neurological disorders along with a discussion of the datasets, limitations, results and research scope of the various techniques.},

	abstract = {The deployment of wearable wireless systems that collect physiological indicators to aid in diagnosing neurological disorders represents a potential solution for the new generation of e-health systems. Electroencephalography (EEG), a recording of the brain’s electrical activity, is a promising physiological test for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders. It can identify the abnormalities of the neural system that are associated with autism spectrum disorders. However, streaming EEG samples remotely for classification can reduce the wireless sensor’s lifespan and creates doubt regarding the application’s feasibility. Therefore, decreasing data transmission may conserve sensor energy and extend the lifespan of wireless sensor networks. This paper suggests the development of a sensor-based scheme for early age autism detection. The proposed scheme implements an energy-efficient method for signal transformation allowing relevant feature extraction for accurate classification using machine learning algorithms. The experimental results indicate an accuracy of 96\%, a sensitivity of 100\%, and around 95\% of F1 score for all used machine learning models. The results also show that our scheme energy consumption is 97\% lower than streaming the raw EEG samples.},

Twenty participants were included in each group. All participants were between the ages of 8 and 12 years, and groups were matched on age and gender. The electroencephalographic (EEG) was recorded during an eyes-closed resting condition from 21 monopolar derivations, which were clustered into nine regions for analysis. The EEGs were Fourier-transformed to provide absolute and relative power estimates for the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. Ratio coefficients were also calculated for the theta/alpha and theta/beta ratios. Compared with controls, the clinical groups demonstrated the increased slow-wave and reduced fast-wave activity commonly reported in the ADHD literature. The ADHD + RD group had more relative theta, less relative alpha, and a higher theta/alpha ratio than the ADHD group. A number of hemispheric differences were also found in the delta and alpha bands. These results suggested that some of the EEG divergences found in the ADHD + RD group represent an electrophysiological component associated with the reading disability that is independent of the EEG divergences found in ADHD.},

	abstract = {Background
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and or impulsivity. Since the development of the concept, a reliable biomarker to aid diagnosis has been sought. One potential method is the use of electroencephalogram to measure neuronal activity. The aim of this review is to provide an up to date synthesis of the literature surrounding the potential use of electroencephalogram for diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adulthood.

Methods
A search of PsycINFO, PubMed, and EMBASE was undertaken in February 2019 for peer-reviewed articles exploring electroencephalogram patterns in adults (18 years with no upper limit) diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Results
Differences in electroencephalogram activity are potentially unique to adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder populations. Strongest support was derived for elevated levels of both absolute and relative theta power, alongside the observation that alpha activity is able to typically differentiate between adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and normative populations.

Conclusions
Electroencephalogram can have a use in clinical settings to aid adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis, but areas of inconsistency are apparent.},

	abstract = {This study considers the differential predictive value of rapid naming tests for various aspects of later reading, where the differential is between nondisabled and poor readers. Two large-N longitudinal samples of students who have been evaluated from third through eighth grades are studied: (a) a randomly accessed, normally distributed group including students with varying degrees of reading ability (N = 154), and (b) a group of poor readers whose single-word reading in third grade is at or below the population 10th percentile (N = 64). Outcomes in fifth and eighth grade were measured in both groups. Single-word reading in both grades was strongly predicted from third-grade rapid naming only within the poor readers, even when IQ, socioeconomc status, and third-grade single-word reading were statistically controlled. Although rapid naming had predictive value within the large, normally distributed group, its predictive power was entirely absent in the average-reading nondisabled students who were between the 10th and 90th percentiles (n = 122). The fact that rapid naming has predictive power only for poor readers but not for average readers is interpreted as suggesting that impaired readers are qualitatively different from the normal-reading population and are not simply the “tail” of a normal distribution of reading ability. It also seems that it is the automaticity of retrieval, not the knowledge of names itself (as in confrontational naming tasks), that gives the predictive power in rapid naming. These data are considered in light of the one-and two-factor theories of the underlying processes involved in reading disability or dyslexia.},

PA and RAN were measured in kindergarten and Grade 1, while word recognition, phonological decoding, and spelling were measured in kindergarten, Grade 1, and Grade 2. In general, high stability was observed for the various reading and spelling measures, such that little additional variance was left open for PA and RAN. However, results demonstrated that RAN was more related to reading than spelling across orthographies, with the opposite pattern shown for PA. In addition, tests of measurement invariance show that the factor loadings of each observed indicator on the latent PA factor was the same across U.S./Australia and Scandinavia. Similar findings were obtained for RAN. In general, tests of structural invariance show that models of early literacy development are highly transferable across languages.},

Factor analyses of these cognitive variables (including auditory processing, phonological awareness, short-term auditory memory, visual memory, rapid automatized naming, and visual processing speed) produced three empirically and theoretically derived factors (auditory processing, visual processing/speed, and memory), each of which contributed to the prediction of reading and spelling skills. Factor scores from the three factors combined predicted 85\% of the variance associated with letter/sight word naming, 70\% of the variance associated with reading comprehension, 73\% for spelling, and 61\% for phonetic decoding. The auditory processing factor was the strongest predictor, accounting for 27\% to 43\% of the variance across the different achievement areas. The results provide practitioner and researcher with theoretical and empirical support for the inclusion of measures of the three factors, in addition to specific measures of reading achievement, in a standardized assessment of dyslexia.
