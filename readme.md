## Abstract
This paper presents the process of creating and evaluating a machine learning model aimed at detecting attention states using electroencephalography (EEG). Dedicated software was developed to record EEG signals during mental arithmetic tasks. Following a data collection campaign, statistical analysis was conducted. The performance of random forests, as well as dense, convolutional, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), was evaluated.
